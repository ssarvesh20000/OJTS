      <p>
      Rayno’s Phantom series is the world’s first carbon ceramic
       film developed with a patented formula that exceeds competitor standards
        for optimal film performance. Nano-scaled carbon particles provide top
         notch color stability without sacrificing clarity, while nano-encapsulated
          ceramic particles give lasting durability and outstanding heat rejection.
      </p>
      <p>
      In short – it’s the perfect combination film to give
       you enhanced privacy and protection from the harmful UVA and UVB
        sun rays while safeguarding your car’s interior and increasing your car’s

      The <a href="https://www.raynofilm.com/automotive/phantom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
      style={{ color: 'orange' }}>
      Phantom Nano Carbon Ceramic
      </a> window film series incorporates innovative
       technology that allows both carbon and ceramic particles to share the duty of
        protecting your car’s interior with the advantages of both while significantly
         reducing the downsides they would have on their own. Our unique formula decreases
          the size of carbon particles down to a nano scale, preventing the haze and glare
           from typical carbon films while maintaining its incredible durability. What’s
            more, by encapsulating high-purity ceramic particles, we’ve further enhanced
             the color stability of ceramic while maintaining its higher visibility. Rayno
              Phantom is an innovative product with improved visibility and durability, with
               higher color stability and heat rejection compared to all other automotive 
               window films and metalized films on the market.

      <h3 style= {{ fontSize: '95%' }}>Health Benefits of Window Film</h3>
      <p>
      To start the conversation about the health benefits gained from using our
       window film, understanding of the amount of Total Solar Energy Rejected (TSER)
        by the film is crucial factor. Like infrared rejection, TSER is a factor in how
         much heat is allowed into your vehicle, but TSER also measures the amount
          of skin and vision damaging light that is emitted into the vehicle as well. 
          During independent testing Rayno Phantom Series films improved TSER by up to
           60% and cut harmful UV and infrared rays by nearly 99 percent over other window
            film brands.What does this mean for you? It’s simple. You’ll drive in comfort
             knowing Rayno’s Phantom is working actively to keep cool and provide superior
              protection – not only for your car, but for you as well.
